## Description

How to make your own gas truck conversion. Currently only the Associated T6 platform is done. TLR may happen if I or someone else feels very motivated to do so.

## Getting Started
First I must say this is a project for experienced hobbyists. There may eventually be ready-to-assemble kit versions, but for now it's DIY only.

  * Heated bed
