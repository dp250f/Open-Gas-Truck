# 3D Printed parts guides

## Description

Different types of parts have their own guides:

* *[0.4mm nozzle](BigNozzle)*
* *[0.25mm nozzle](SmallNozzle)*

## Prerequisites

* 3D printer(s) with the following capabilities (for printing carbon-fiber PA6 Nylon)
    * Hard 0.4mm and 0.25mm nozzle (hardened steel or equivalent)
    * 300Â°C capable hot-end (make sure you hot-tighten it at that temperature)
    * Heated bed
* Filament dryer
* High quality Carbon-Fiber filled PA6 filament (I used Polymaker Polymide CF-PA6)
* Magigoo or equivalent PA bed adhesive

# Before printing parts...

Save yourself from future headaches and do some tuning. This material prints very different than PLA. It's also expensive, so these test prints are pretty minimal.

## Tune Extrusion Multiplier

Because CF-Nylon likes to absorb moisture, it's nearly impossible to keep it completely dry without storing it in a vacuum chamber. I've also found my E-steps are off compared to PLA due to how hard this stuff is. Rather than throw off E-steps for printing other types of filament, it's easier to tune extrusion multiplier for this material (you'll need to even if you do re-tune your E-steps).

* Print small 20x20x2 calibration cubes at 100% infill to determine what multiplier to use. Make sure you use the same extrusion width, layer height, and infill/skin overlap settings you will be using to print your parts. (Yeah, it shouldn't matter, but slicers can be weird.) You want a smooth top surface with no gaps and just a little bit of roughness that you can see and feel with your fingernail around the edges of the infill where it overlaps the perimeters.
* This can vary depending on how dry your filament is. 0.86 (or 86%) is the multiplier I ended up using after it's been out of the vacuum sealed packaging for a day or so (I don't have a vacuum chamber to store it in). In theory, if you can get this stuff completely dry and re-tune your E-steps, it'll be 1.00. In my opinion, it's just not worth that much hassle. I always store it in a sealed bag with desiccant in the box it came in and always print from the filament dryer (and leave it in there all day every time I do)
* Dimensional accuracy is less important for most parts and layer adhesion is most important, so err on the side of over-extrusion.

## Tune Bridge Flow Ratio

CF-Nylon doesn't seem to exhibit die-swell and shrinking like PLA does, which makes bridging more difficult. Excellent bridging can still be accomplished with CF-Nylon, but it requires a much lower flow ratio than you're used to. It can also re-melt and warp/sag the bridging layer when printing the next layer - but there's a workaround for that.

These were printed at 30mm/s bridge speed. First number is flow ratio percent and 2nd number is fan speed. The top piece is without bridge cooling, just for reference

* Print 30x50x3 bridging test cubes with 0% infill and no support, 0 bottom layers, 2 top layers and 3 perimeters.
* Try different speeds and flow ratios with 100% bridge fan speed. Usually 20mm/s-30mm/s and 40%-70% flow ratio.
* I like to stop the test print a little more than half-way through the last layer so I can see both the bridging layer by itself and with the next layer on top of it.
* You want a bridge layer which produces the smoothest and flattest top layer possible. In these pictures, you can see that's probably somewhere around 55%-60%
